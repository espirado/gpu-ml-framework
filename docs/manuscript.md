# Towards Autonomous Infrastructure Learning: Behavioral Pattern‑Driven Optimization for Sustainable and Socially Responsible ML Infrastructure

## Abstract
Modern ML training clusters frequently suffer from resource underutilization due to inflexible reservations, GPU over‑provisioning, and reactive scheduling. We propose autonomous infrastructure learning that recognizes behavioral patterns in event sequences to predict and mitigate resource inefficiencies before they manifest. Using Alibaba cluster traces and controlled synthetic workloads, we study three contributions: (1) behavioral pattern detection over temporal sequences (including CRE‑inspired templates and data‑driven methods), (2) a proof‑of‑concept optimization engine that maps detected patterns to scheduling recommendations, and (3) an impact assessment framework quantifying utilization, queueing, cost, and accessibility. We outline an evaluation plan with trace‑driven simulation and controlled testbeds, with success criteria grounded in utilization improvement and statistical significance. The goal is a sustainable, socially responsible approach to ML infrastructure that reduces waste and broadens access.

## 1. Introduction
Context, motivation, and limitations of reactive schedulers (Gandiva, Tiresias, Optimus, Pollux). Positioning of pattern‑driven predictive optimization for sustainability and access.

## 2. Problem Statement
Resource hoarding, queue spiraling, accessibility barriers; research questions and hypotheses.

## 3. Dataset Description / Preprocessing (Weight 16%)
- Sources: synthetic logs reflecting auth/network/DB/app failure modes; optional augmentation with Alibaba traces for load dynamics. No PII retained.
- Schema: timestamp, host, facility, severity, message, labels{service,component}, target_category.
- Preprocessing: timezone normalization; severity mapping; rule‑based PII masks; dedup by `(timestamp,host,message)`; class‑balanced stratified split; tokenization with length caps.
- Quality checks: per‑class counts, missingness, message length, leakage scans (prevent same incident appearing in train and test).

## 4. Problem Formulation (Weight 16%)
- Task: supervised multi‑class classification of log messages into operational categories; optional sequence labeling for root‑cause terms.
- Inputs: log messages and metadata; Outputs: \(y\in\{Security, Network, Memory, Storage, Application, Other\}\).
- Metrics: accuracy, macro‑F1, per‑class precision/recall/F1, confusion matrix; calibration (ECE, Brier); latency p50/p95.
- Significance: 5x2 CV with bootstrap CIs; McNemar’s test on paired predictions.

## 5. Behavioral Pattern Detection Module
- Event‑sequence mining (CRE‑inspired templates, frequent episode mining, statistical tests over windowed features).
- Topology‑aware analysis with graph methods for co‑location and interference.

## 6. Proof‑of‑Concept Optimization Engine
- Pattern‑to‑action mapping for scheduling suggestions; feasibility with eBPF‑based signal taps.

## 7. ML Approaches (Baseline Models)
- Baselines:
  - Linear: TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression (strong interpretable baseline).
  - Tree ensemble: LightGBM on TF‑IDF or hashed features.
- Representation:
  - Classical: character/word TF‑IDF; n‑grams with sublinear TF.
  - Modern: sentence embeddings (e.g., all‑MiniLM) for compact dense features.
- Model selection: stratified 5‑fold CV; class‑balanced weighting; threshold tuning per class.
- Calibration: Platt scaling / isotonic regression; report ECE and Brier.

## 8. Methodology (Process)
- Data preparation: deterministic splits, leakage checks, reproducible seeds.
- Cross‑validation: StratifiedKFold (k=5); per‑fold reports saved to JSON.
- Uncertainty: bootstrap 95% confidence intervals over fold macro‑F1.
- Metrics: macro‑F1, per‑class PR/F1, ECE, Brier; confusion matrices.
- Artifacts: saved under `results/models/` with exact configs.

## 9. Results (Initial)
- Provide CV macro‑F1 with 95% CI for TF‑IDF+LogReg and TF‑IDF+LightGBM.
- Include calibration metrics (ECE/Brier) and confusion matrices.
- Discuss error modes and class imbalance impacts.

## 4. Initial Empirical Results (Weight 17%)
- TF‑IDF + Logistic vs LightGBM vs Embedding + Logistic.
- Report macro‑F1 and per‑class PR/F1 with 95% CIs; calibration metrics; inference latency on CPU.

## 5. Previous Work Survey (Weight 17%)
- Log parsing/anomaly detection, AIOps incident classification, classical vs neural text classifiers, calibration in classification.

## 6. Reference Citations (Weight 17%)
- Include standards for evaluation (ECE/Brier), AIOps, log mining, and dataset/traces used.

## Appendix: Reproducibility
- Data card, scripts, seeds, environment, and command lines.
